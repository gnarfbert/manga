# Project Motivation:
* Ever since I started learning about web development, I really wanted to learn about how the backend communicates to the frontend. So I made manga tracking website to learn more about making requests to an API endpoint and using that the response data to update manga information in the frontend. I chose manga as the theme because I have been reading them since I was a junior in high school and wanted to share how much joy this underappreciated media can bring. I also thought that the many public manga databases and documentation for these databases would serve as a great introduction to working with different kinds of databases. Developing this website has been a great learning opportunity as well as a fun one. I hope to take what I have learned about the backend on this web application to future web applications I will develop! 

# Technologies Used:
In this application, I used React.js to create the display of the manga cards while using CSS to style the application. I made use of GraphQL to store data and make queries to the manga database. While this is my first time working with GraphQL, I ended up really liking the simplicity of making queries to get data on manga.
